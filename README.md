Shear and Bending Moment Calculator
===================================

This android application is a simple application that calculates the shear
and bending moments along the length of a loaded beam. As of now, the two 
type of beams supported are simple beams and cantilevered beams. This app
would be of great use for your average 2nd/3rd year civil engineering student.

Things to add...
- Shinier starting screen
- Moment addition support
- Values of all loads above their images

KNOWN BUGS!
- Moving the ending position of the distributed loads to a position left of 
its respective starting position causes erroneous results.
