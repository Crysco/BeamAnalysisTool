Shear and Bending Moment Calculator
===================================

This android application is a simple application that calculates the shear
and bending moments along the length of a loaded beam. As of now, the two 
type of beams supported are simple beams and cantilevered beams. 

KNOWN BUGS!
- Moving the ending position of the distributed loads to a position left of 
its respective starting position causes erroneous results.
